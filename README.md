# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning
 Diabetic Retinopathy Prediction Project: Utilizing deep learning (TensorFlow, Keras), our team developed a web app (Streamlit) to predict diabetic retinopathy severity from fundus images. Trained on a ResNet50 model, the application provides rapid predictions with high accuracy, enhancing early diagnosis and intervention
